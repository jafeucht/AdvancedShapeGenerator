Title: Advanced Shape Generator 3.0
Description: Three projects are included in this archive. The first is an ActiveX DLL update of the advanced shape generator. What this class does is takes a series of vectors (such as 36 at 54º) and sequences through them, then repeats itself as many times as it takes until the process closes on itself. A byproduct of this operation is an enclosed shape, where the beginning point meets the end point. All enclosed shapes can be created in this manner, which I call "Vector Sequencing".
The second project allows you to do just that. It is a test application which allows you to experiment with different properties of the csShape, and provides a decent example on how to use the csShape class in code.
The third project included is a screen saver which uses the csShape class to create random shapes and changing colors. It is a fine example of how to create a complete screen saver that uses password, docks itself into a screen (providing you provide correct command line arguments), and more.
Have fun with this 3-in-one givaway. It was alot of work, and I hope you find it interesting.
